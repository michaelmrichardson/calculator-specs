The Windows Calculator app is a modern Windows app written in C++ that ships pre-installed with Windows.
This repository contains in-progress and archived spec documents for new features in
[Microsoft/calculator](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator).

Documents in this repo are used for features in development and are not intended to be up-to-date
developer or user documentation. For product issues, bugs, and feature requests please go to
[Microsoft/calculator](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator).

## Contributing
We welcome your contributions to the project, and we thank you for your interest in making Calculator
better! We follow a
[user-centered process for developing features](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/blob/master/docs/NewFeatureProcess.md).

### Workflow

1. Ensure that your pitch has been approved and moved into
   [planning](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/projects/1). When features enter this stage,
   a new working branch in this repo will be created: `feature/<feature>`

2. ectory for your spec under the `active` directory: `/active/<feature>`.

3. Write your spec following the [spec template](./spec_template.md), leveraging relative links when
   referencing images or other assets in the directory.  Rename your file as `README.md`.

5. Once all feedback has been addressed and your spec has been merged into `master`, your feature will
   move into [implementation](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/projects/1).

6. After your feature is merged into `master` in the [Calculator](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator)
   project, you can submit a pull request to move your spec from `active` to `archive`.  (We'll do
   this for you if we don't see the pull request come in after some time.)

### Spec review
Once there is a high-fidelity design which addresses the goals described in the original pitch, the
Microsoft product team will review the spec and ensure all items on this checklist are addressed:

- [ ] Is there a high-fidelity design which gives reviewers a clear idea of how the feature will
  look and function when implemented?
- [ ] Has the plan been shared with the community and have others been given an opportunity to provide
  suggestions?
- [ ] Are [Fluent design principles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/fluent-design-system/)
  followed? If we do something which deviates from the guidelines, do we have a good reason?
- [ ] Does the design include provisions for
  [all users](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/accessibility/designing-inclusive-software)
  and [all cultures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/globalizing/guidelines-and-checklist-for-globalizing-your-app)?
- [ ] Is it technically feasible to build this feature? Take a look at the
  ["before committing" checklist](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/blob/master/docs/NewFeatureProcess.md#technical-review)
  and identify any issues which are likely to be blockers.
